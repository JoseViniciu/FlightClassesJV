# Flight Class Scheduling

Welcome to the Flight Class Scheduling project! This project provides a web-based platform for scheduling flight classes, offering users an intuitive interface to learn about our services and book their classes.

## Project Overview

The Flight Class Scheduling application includes the following key components:

- **Main HTML Page**: Located in `src/index.html`, this page features sections that introduce our organization, describe the types of planes used for training, provide information about the pilot instructor, and include a form for scheduling classes.

- **Styling**: The `src/css/styles.css` file contains all the necessary styles to ensure the application is visually appealing and user-friendly.

- **JavaScript Functionality**: The `src/js/main.js` file handles the interactive elements of the scheduling page, including form validation and user input management.
